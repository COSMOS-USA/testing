<h1> The Wizard of Oz</h1>
<h2>L. Frank Baum</h2>
<p>"Then I shall never have courage," <em><ans><strong>declared the Lion.</strong></ans></em></p>
<p>"And I shall never have brains," <em><ans><strong>added the Scarecrow.</strong></ans></em></p>
<p>"And I shall never have a heart," <em><ans><strong>spoke the Tin Woodman.</strong></ans></em></p>
<p>"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry," <em><ans><strong>said Dorothy, beginning to cry.</strong></ans></em></p>
<p>"Be careful!" cried the green girl. "The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it."</p>
<p>So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, "I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again."</p>
